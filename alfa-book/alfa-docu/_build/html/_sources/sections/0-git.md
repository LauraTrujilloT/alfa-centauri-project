# How to install Git

## Installing Git on macOS using Terminal

To install Git using the terminal on macOS, follow these steps:

1. Open the Terminal application on your macOS.

2. Check if Git is already installed by running the following command:
`git --version`

If Git is already installed, it will display the version number. If not, it will prompt you to install it.

1. If Git is not installed, you can use Homebrew, a package manager for macOS, to simplify the installation process. If you don't have Homebrew, install Homebrew as showed previously.

2. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Homebrew installation. You may be asked to enter your administrator password.

3. Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install Git by running the following command in the terminal: `brew install git`

4. Homebrew will download and install Git along with its dependencies. This process may take a few moments.

5. To verify that Git is successfully installed, run the following command: `git --version`

If Git is installed correctly, the terminal will display the Git version number.

Congratulations! Git is now installed on your macOS using the terminal. You can start using Git for version control and collaboration on your projects.

Enjoy working with Git!
