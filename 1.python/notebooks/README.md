# Our cool notebooks

- [Class 1]() : About variable types in Python, how to create functions, and a neat way to apply our knowledge of funcions : Calculation of CLTV

-[Class 2]() : All about conditionals, a bit of logic, and some sweet exercises to keep track of all the above.

-[Class 3]() : iterations over and over. For loops, while loops...Things that helps us to go over element by element, or row by row in our collections of data.

-[Class 4]() : Ok, so we have a basic idea of the logic, what an object is, what types of data are out there, but how can we start manipulating tables, data and analyzing it? Enter pandas. There are many ways and libraries for doing that, but we're gonna start with one of the mainstream ones, which is [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/). 

-[Class 5](): Cool, we now have a pretty good idea of how to manipulate data as DataFrames in pandas. How can we visualize stuff?
