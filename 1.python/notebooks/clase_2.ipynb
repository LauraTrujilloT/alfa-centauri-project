Those logical decisions are summarized as boolean variables (either True or False; 1 or 0), and conditional statements in programming allows us to \"help\" the computer to execute or \"go-ahead\" with some decisions or actions if some operation is True (or False), or if some line of thought is False (or True), and so on.\n",
